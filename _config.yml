# History Block
history1: "MSS was first held in 2013 as a gathering of local science graduate research students to share and discuss their research findings. Since then, it has grown in size and scope to include the student community of other local and international universities and research institutes. True to the Monash motto “<em>Ancora Imparo</em>”, the Symposium aims to enhance the science learning experience by encouraging knowledge exchange between researchers, promoting local research work, exploring potential collaborations, and fostering closer ties with other research universities."
history2: "In 2014, the Symposium has registered more than 150 student participants, half of which represent participants from 9 other different local universities/research institutes. In 2016, the symposium was held with more registered participants, including external participants who were from 13 universities and a government agency. A new scope was introduced in MSS 2016, covering a total of 6 major life sciences branches and were presented over 3-day periods. The Symposium had received overwhelming positive feedback from the participants. In 2018, an intervarsity symposium which served as a promotional event to highlight the capabilities of HDR students of Monash University Malaysia in producing quality research outputs and the dissemination of their scientific findings to a broader audience."
history3: "For MSS 2022, we intend to continue the legacy by making the event bigger as well as introduce a new science category, “Science Communication and Safety”. We also intend to encourage supervisors/lecturers to partake in MSS 2022 as the scientific committee which would assist in the abstract screening process.  We therefore propose for an intervarsity symposium to be held for the graduate research students, staff and company agencies."

webinar1Title: "#1 Pandemic Preparedness: Challenges Faced and Lessons Learnt"
webinar1Description: "The first webinar from the Mini Science Series was about how we can better prepare for the pandemic and the lessons we have learnt from it thus far."
webinar1Video: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/oiZH1XhyYuY"
webinar1Points:
 - {point: "Many methodologies and technology that were developed for cancer research can actually be applied for control of the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, the novel method to discover cancer-inducing DNA can be used for rapid and convenient screening of the Covid-19 virus."}
 - {point: "Although right now the research of Covid-19 required a lot of attention, research focus should not be taken away from other fields that still need problem-solving, for example in the environmental and cancer field."}
 - {point: "There is generally a lack of accurate interface between scientists and the public. So when the public receives misinformation, this is a challenge for the medical field when the public over-purchases medical supplies unnecessarily."}
 - {point: "Mobile devices and technologies have become important now to replace face-to-face learning and become accessible to many people at one time. Collaborate technologies have recently been embraced for work connections across the globe."}
 - {point: "Cyber security would be a rising issue for e-learning in the future. Academic integrity and assessments are coming up to be areas of concern when it comes to online learning."}
webinar1Questions:
 - {point: "How will e-learning cater to the underprivileged?"}
 - {point: "What do you think Monash can do to bridge the gap between researchers and the public?"}
 - {point: "What are the panellists' opinions on COVID-19 towards postgraduate research progress?"}

webinar2Title: "#2 Am I OK? Adapting to the New Norm During a Pandemic"
webinar2Description: "In these tough times, while everyone is adapting to a new norm, we sometimes forget to stop for a minute, breathe and ask ourselves 'Am I OK?'. In the second webinar, we were joined by a panel of experts specializing in Nutrition, Psychiatry & Psychology."
webinar2Video: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/hgfhAucc1JM"
webinar2Points:
 - {point: "Covid-19 has increased depression, anxiety, stress, trauma, eating disorders and self-harm among people globally. These effects are seen more in younger people, women, those with lower formal education, those single, those living with children, and those living in affected countries."}
 - {point: "These effects are normal responses to a prolonged traumatic event such as the Covid-19 pandemic. However, there are ways to cope while going through this pandemic. These include taking back control in your daily activities despite being stuck at home, practicing healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle, and using social media positively."}
 - {point: "Stigma around Covid-19 also affects our physical and psychological well-being. It also stops people from getting tested and treated and prevents contact tracing of Covid-19."}
 - {point: "Traumatic events can trigger the onset of mental illness like anxiety and depression, especially for people who have an anxious personality."}
 - {point: "Food and diet affect our brain by the production of certain neurotransmitters. So when we are stressed, we turn to food to try and make us feel better. But poor diet choices can actually make us feel worse."}
 - {point: "Incorporating the Mediterranean diet can help improve mental and physical well-being. Taking in moderate amounts of every food group, and not eliminating any groups because each group plays an important role in our body."}
 - {point: "Some good eating habits to remember during the pandemic is to track your eating habits, snack on healthy foods, practice mindful eating, keep your mind engaged, drink a lot of water, and cook at home more often."}

 - {point: "When do we know when to seek help? What are the clinical signs and symptoms we should look out for to tell us that we need to see a psychologist or psychiatrist?"}
 - {point: "Is there any evidence for the cultivation of certain habits that can help create a positive mental state or environment?"}
 - {point: "What if this MCO (Malaysia's Movement Control Order) had made me feel like not doing anything, I am losing my passion and I am becoming unproductive. Do I have anxiety issues?"}
 - {point: "How do we curb the negative stigma on mental health?"}
