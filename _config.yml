# About MSS Block
aboutMSSBlockTitle: "About MSS"
aboutMSS: "The Monash Science Symposium (MSS) is a student-led event by the School of Science postgraduate students of Monash University Malaysia (MUM). We hope to initiate the conference as an annual event that acts as a platform for students to gain experience and valuable insight towards their research. It also serves as a promotional event to highlight the capabilities of postgraduates in research outputs and the dissemination of their scientific findings to a broader, and ideally, international audience. Gala networking dinner is expected to be an event which prioritizes networking and collaboration. It is also can be the future direction of this event will aim to showcase research here in Monash to engage with other universities and industries to increase the networking opportunities."
objectives:
  - {objective: "Provide a platform for researchers from around the world to exchange ideas, establish collaborations and have meaningful discussions on current scientific issues​."}
  - {objective: "Allow the establishment of professional relations with other sectors (industries, research institutes and non-academia)."}
  - {objective: "Increase the number of local and international participants​."}
  - {objective: "Establish a more significant relation with government institutes and industries."}

# History Block
history1: "MSS was first held in 2013 as a gathering of local science graduate research students to share and discuss their research findings. Since then, it has grown in size and scope to include the student community of other local and international universities and research institutes. True to the Monash motto “Ancora imparo”, the Symposium aims to enhance the science learning experience by encouraging knowledge exchange between researchers, promoting local research work, exploring potential collaborations, and fostering closer ties with other research universities."
history2: "In 2014, the Symposium has registered more than 150 student participants, half of which represent participants from 9 other different local universities/research institutes. In 2016, the symposium was held with more registered participants, including external participants who were from 13 universities and a government agency. A new scope was introduced in MSS 2016, covering a total of 6 major life sciences branches and were presented over 3-day periods. The Symposium had received overwhelming positive feedback from the participants. In 2018, an intervarsity symposium which served as a promotional event to highlight the capabilities of HDR students of Monash University Malaysia in producing quality research outputs and the dissemination of their scientific findings to a broader audience."
history3: "For MSS 2021, we intend to continue the legacy by making the event bigger as well as introduce a new science category, “Science Communication and Safety”. We also intend to encourage supervisors/lecturers to partake in MSS 2021 as the scientific committee which would assist in the abstract screening process.  We therefore propose for an intervarsity symposium to be held for the graduate research students, staff and company agencies."

We realize that this is pretty short notice so we hope you can help us spread the word! There will be pizza, prizes and a great group of geeks to spend the evening coding with! Even if you don't have an app idea come on in and lend a hand to someone else or maybe find inspiration once you're here!"}

He knows his way around Android SDK, already checked the Glass Developement Kit (GDK) quick start guide allowing him to jump start developing an app for Glass.The Designer has the hard task to build the visual identity from the ground up, he has strong UX knowledge and a deep understanding of the new rules set by the Glass. His design skills give him the credibility to decide the most effective UI and the most compelling Glass experience."}

Web components are small elements on a page that can be extended and incorporated in web applications. The result is an increase in productivity.<br><br>We used Polymer mainly to explore the concept of web components. The transition of Google to material design was also a factor.While the library was never touched by the team, it still was painless to wireframe the application. Later on we incorporated some Polymer components in the design. We didn’t use the full potential of Polymer because of the limited time."}
