webinar4Description: "We had our latest webinar on the 17th November 2021 which was titled <em>COVID-19 vaccines: Which is better? Does it really matter?</em> Hear what our experts have to say on vaccines."
webinar4Points:
 - {point: "Vaccines stimulate antibodies to fight against bacteria or viruses so that when there is an actual infection, the person will be immune to it. The types of vaccines available against SARs-CoV-2 include attenuated virus vaccines, inactivated virus vaccines, adenovirus vector vaccines, and mRNA vaccines."}
 - {point: "Common side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines include pain at the injection site, fever, fatigue, headache and muscle aches."}
 - {point: "Studies confirm booster shots reduce the rate of severe diseases for those above the 40-year-old age group. Studies also show the decline in COVID-19 cases after booster shots in other countries."}
 - {point: "The number of COVID-19 cases in children below 18 have increased from 2020 to 2021."}
 - {point: "The data shows that vaccines are effective for adolescents. There were no significant signs of severe side effects in vaccinated adolescents."}
 - {point: "In terms of the acceptance rate of COVID-19 vaccines in Malaysia, up to 17% are unsure and 16% will not take it. Hesitancy is higher in certain areas of Malaysia. Hesitancy is mainly due to being unsure or suspicious of the contents of the vaccines."}
webinar4Questions:
 - {point: "Can excessive use of vaccines lead to the emergence of variants as the virus tries to overcome the vaccine?"}
 - {point: "Which vaccines (e.g. Pfizer, Moderna) going to be included in the booster shots?"}
 - {point: "How do you think the government should go about educating the people?"}
 - {point: "How long will the booster shots last?"}
 - {point: "If the majority are vaccinated or if herd immunity is achieved, will there still be any public health intervention?"}
 - {point: "Will vaccine passports be used to filter people who received two or three shots when they enter or exit another country?"}
 - {point: "Could parents get infected from kids who have been exposed to COVID-19 in their schools?"}
 - {point: "How do you deal with someone that you know that does not want to be vaccinated?"}
 - {point: "What are heterologous vaccines?"}
 - {point: "Is a fourth booster shot advisable in Malaysia?"}

# About MSS Block
aboutMSSBlockTitle: "About MSS"
aboutMSS: "The Monash Science Symposium (MSS) is a student-led event by the School of Science postgraduate students of Monash University Malaysia (MUM). We hope to initiate the conference as an annual event that acts as a platform for students to gain experience and valuable insight towards their research. It also serves as a promotional event to highlight the capabilities of postgraduates in research outputs and the dissemination of their scientific findings to a broader, and ideally, international audience. It is also can be the future direction of this event will aim to showcase research here in Monash to engage with other universities and industries to increase the networking opportunities."
objectives:
  - {objective: "Provide a platform for researchers from around the world to exchange ideas, establish collaborations and have meaningful discussions on current scientific issues​."}
  - {objective: "Allow the establishment of professional relations with other sectors (industries, research institutes and non-academia)."}
  - {objective: "Increase the number of local and international participants​."}
  - {objective: "Establish a more significant relation with government institutes and industries."}

# History Block
history1: "MSS was first held in 2013 as a gathering of local science graduate research students to share and discuss their research findings. Since then, it has grown in size and scope to include the student community of other local and international universities and research institutes. True to the Monash motto “<em>Ancora Imparo</em>”, the Symposium aims to enhance the science learning experience by encouraging knowledge exchange between researchers, promoting local research work, exploring potential collaborations, and fostering closer ties with other research universities."
history2: "In 2014, the Symposium has registered more than 150 student participants, half of which represent participants from 9 other different local universities/research institutes. In 2016, the symposium was held with more registered participants, including external participants who were from 13 universities and a government agency. A new scope was introduced in MSS 2016, covering a total of 6 major life sciences branches and were presented over 3-day periods. The Symposium had received overwhelming positive feedback from the participants. In 2018, an intervarsity symposium which served as a promotional event to highlight the capabilities of HDR students of Monash University Malaysia in producing quality research outputs and the dissemination of their scientific findings to a broader audience."
history3: "For MSS 2022, we intend to continue the legacy by making the event bigger as well as introduce a new science category, “Science Communication and Safety”. We also intend to encourage supervisors/lecturers to partake in MSS 2022 as the scientific committee which would assist in the abstract screening process.  We therefore propose for an intervarsity symposium to be held for the graduate research students, staff and company agencies."
